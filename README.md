Meteors are falling from the sky! Move left and right to dodge them, or shoot to destroy them. Survive until the end to win, but be careful - if you get hit even once, you lose.

The goal of the game is to survive until the end while getting as high of a score as possible. Your score increases as time passes, but you can increase it more by shooting down meteors and surviving stages of meteors falling.

## Download

The game is available on both Mac and Windows. Download options are available on the right side of this page under the "Releases" section. All applications function exactly the same. The "Latest" label next to the "Windows" title is irrelevant.

### Windows

There are 2 download options for Windows. Both of them work and function the same. You can use the installer if you want to be a bit fancier, or just the zip file if that makes you more comfortable.

#### Installer

Download and run "MeteorRushSetup.exe" to install the game. It'll give you the options of where to save the game, if you want to add it to your start menu, and if you want to add a desktop shortcut. Click the desktop shortcut or "MeteorRush.exe" after installation to run the game.

#### Zip File

Download and unzip "MeteorRush.zip" to install the game. You can right-click "MeteorRush.exe" and select "Create Shortcut" to make a desktop shortcut if you'd like. Click the desktop shortcut or "MeteorRush.exe" after unzipping the file to run the game.

### Mac

Download and unzip "MeteorRush.zip" to install the game, and run the .app file to play the game. You may need to bypass the Apple doesn't trust this software warning to run the app. There are ways to allow the app to run by either going through [System Settings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445#:~:text=Open%20System%20Settings.,anyway%2C%20you%20can%20click%20Open) or the [Finder](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

## Controls

The controls are also shown in the game, but they are below as well:
- B: go back to the menu or cancel an action (clearing high scores, restarting, quitting) when the confirmation pops up
- Q: quit/exit the app
- R: restart the game (current game will not be saved if you restart)
- left/right arrow keys or A/D: move left/right
- up/down arrow keys or W/S: shoot directly up
- P/space: pause/unpause

## Additional Info

- The rover can only move left and right, bullets can only be shot upwards, and meteors always fall downwards.
- There is no sound.
- There are no mouse controls. All controls are keyboard controls.
- The mouse cursor is invisible (not disabled) inside the window of the game. Move the cursor outside the window of the game to see it again.
- Your top 10 high scores are saved. You can choose to clear them if you would like, but the action cannot be undone if you confirm the clear.
- Don't try to change the high scores in the save file. You won't be able to do it. If you mess it up, all your saved scores will be automatically cleared.
- High scores are automatically updated and saved as soon as each game is finished (whether you win or lose). If you choose to restart or quit in the middle of a game, that score is not saved.
- There are 6 stages, each of which lasts about 30 seconds, so a full game takes a little over 3 minutes.
- See below on information about screen sizes.

## Game Window Size

You can change the size of the window at any point during the game to one of the following options using its corresponding key:
- 640 x 480: 1 (default)
- 960 x 720: 2
- 1280 x 960: 3

The game window size can't be set to any other size nor set to full screen. You can use either the number keys at the top of the keyboard or the numpad on the side (if your keyboard has it) to set the window size.
