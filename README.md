# Meteor Rush
###### by Pranav Koduri
---
Meteors are falling from the sky! Move left and right to dodge them, or shoot to destroy them. Survive until the end to win, but be careful - if you get hit even once, you lose.

The goal of the game is to survive until the end while getting as high of a score as possible. Your score increases as time passes, but you can increase it more by shooting down meteors and surviving stages of meteors falling.

There are 6 stages, each of which takes about 30 seconds, so a full game lasts a little over 3 minutes.

## Download

The game is available on both Mac and Windows. Both platforms have 3 window sizes you can choose from: 
- 640 x 480
- 960 x 720
- 1280 x 960

All 6 download options are available on the right side of this page under the "Releases" section.

### Windows

Download and run the installer to play the game. It'll give you the option of where to save the game, if you want to add it to your start menu, and an option to add a desktop shortcut.

### Mac

Unzip the file where you would like to save the game, and run the .app file to play the game.

## Controls

The controls are also shown in the game, but they are below as well:
- B: go back to the menu or cancel an action (clearing high scores, restarting, quitting) when the confirmation pops up
- Q: quit/exit the app
- R: restart the game (current game will not be saved if you restart"
- left/right arrow keys or A/D: move left/right
- up/down arrow keys or W/S: shoot directly up
- P/space: pause/unpause

## Additional Info

- The rover can only move left and right, bullets can only be shot upwards, and meteors always fall downwards.
- There is no sound.
- There are no mouse controls. All controls are keyboard controls.
- The mouse cursor is invisible (not disabled) inside the window of the game. Move the cursor outside the window of the game to see it again.
- The game window size can be neither changed nor set to full screen.
- Your top 10 high scores are saved. You can choose to clear them if you would like, but the action cannot be undone if you confirm the clear.
- Don't try to change the high scores in the save file. You won't be able to do it. If you mess it up, all your saved scores will be automatically cleared.
- High scores are automatically updated and saved as soon as each game is finished (whether you win or lose). If you choose to restart or quit in the middle of a game, that score is not saved.
